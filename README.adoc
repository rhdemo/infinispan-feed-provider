= Infinispan Feed Provider

This project acts as `Provider Service` that helps in implementing OpenWhisk Feeds
via https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/docs/feeds.md#implementing-feeds-via-connections[Connections]

In this demo provider service registers Infinispan Remote ClientCacheListener as
a event source to OpenWhisk triggers. When ever a Cache Entry is created/deleted/updated
this Feed will fire all the associated Triggers with event data as payload.

Refer to the following links for more information on Triggers, Rules and Feeds

* https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/docs/triggers_rules.md[Triggers and Rules]
* https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/docs/feeds.md[Feeds]
